This project focuses on determining if weather conditions affect Beach Volleyball's main game stats (kills, errors, aces, etc) in a meaninful way and quantify it. I began by gathering information and assumptions from my own experience in playing beach volleyball, from online researh and Professor Abramson's volleybal player contacts. After this, I decided to test the following hypothesis: <br>
1- Higher wind speed increase the probability of Aces per point played. This is based on information that Serves performed when there are higher wind speed the balls lands sooner. <br>
2- Location affects the probability of Kills per point played. (For instance, sand depth might affect the number of kills by making it harder to jump). <br>
3- Rain increases the probability of Serve Errors per point played. <br>
4.1- Higher temperatures affect the probability of Errors per point played. <br>
4.2- Minutes played at higher temperature affect the probability of Errors per point played. As this may cause increased fatigue in players. <br>
5- Humidity increases the probability of Kills per point played. Moisture/rain packs sand which can make it easier to jump, thus, creating more kills. <br>
6- Lower atmospheric pressure increases the probability of Errors per point played. Lower pressure may make the ball fall further and cause more out of bounds.
